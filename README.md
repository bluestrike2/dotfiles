# dotfiles

Feel free to fork them, use them, or just plain ignore them. Whatever works for you.

Initial setup uses the [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) shell script
to get everything up and running. Relies on zsh and [sorin-ionescu/prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto). Dotfiles are managed with [thoughtbot/rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).
